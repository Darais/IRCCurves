The files in this directory are examples for the config files needed for irccurves.

Each of these .xml files specifies certain properties needed by the respective component.
The linking between component and configuration is done in the config.xml file in
the Curves package.

In the example config.xml in the Curves package these component configuration files are
assumed to be in the properties directory (like system.xml).
